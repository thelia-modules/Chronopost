- Others will be added in future versions

## Installation

### Manually

* Copy the module into ```<thelia_root>/local/modules/``` directory and be sure that the name of the module is Chronopost.
* Activate it in your thelia administration panel

### Composer

Add it in your main thelia composer.json file

```
composer require thelia/chronopost-module:~1.0
```

## Usage

First, go to your back office, tab Modules, and activate the module Chronopost.
Then go to Chronopost configuration page, tab "Advanced Configuration" and fill the required fields.

After activating the delivery types you wih to use, new tabs will appear. With these, you can
change the shipping prices according to the delivery type and the area, and/or activate free shipping for a given price and/or given area, or just
activate it no matter the are and cart amount.

To download labels without having to go on the directory in the server, use the "Export labels" tab and click on the save icon
when a label has been created.
Labels are automatically created when you put the order on the status ID you entered in the configuration form,
usually the treatment status.
---
For relay / pickup points, you need to integrate a template to choose one relay in the list provided by the loop 'chronopost.get.relay'.
Ideally from a map, like google maps, yandex, or similar. 

Then, you can either create an entry in the address table and use it immediately,
or overload the thelia.order.delivery form to accept entire addresses as input instead of only an address id
from which to get the entire address.
